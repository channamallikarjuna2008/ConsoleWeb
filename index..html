            Console is a basic computer or monitor and keyboard that is connected to another computer, server, or a mainframe over a network. It is used to maintain or monitor the status of the network or computer.
                A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. These consoles typically include a
                mouse for navigating graphical interfaces. ... The terms "console" and "terminal" are often used synonymously. Thanks for reading about console!
